# üîÅ Fragments Navigation Demo - Android App

This Android application demonstrates smooth navigation between **three fragments** using either the Android Navigation Component or manual `FragmentTransaction`. It's ideal for learning how to handle fragment-based UI structures in modern Android development.

## What Are Fragments?

In Android, a **Fragment** is a reusable portion of the user interface within an activity. Fragments allow developers to build dynamic and flexible UIs by dividing an activity into modular sections. Each fragment has its own lifecycle, UI layout, and behavior, but always exists within a parent **Activity**.

**Why use Fragments?**
- Modular and reusable UI components
- Easier to manage navigation in multi-pane layouts (e.g., tablets)
- Ideal for building single-activity apps with multiple screens

The app consists of three fragments:
